# Tic-Tac-Toe with Python

I made this project after going through a few solutions just to see how different people approached it in different ways.
Main thing I learned by building this simple game is to improvise. I did improvise before but that improvisation was always a small feature. However, for this project I gave a challange to myself to try to build tic tac toe my own way and based on what I saw other people were doing. 
You can see that the result turned out to be fine.

### Things I want to do next with this project:
 + Add detailed comments
 + Make game board reappear after player makes a move so that the board stays in place all the time
 + Implement a one player game feature | make a bot to play against player
 + **MAYBE** make a simple gui :)
 
*Project has some kind of worth to me because, as I said, it helped me by teaching me to improvise, made me understand the game even more so I can finish the project easier.
Can't wait for rest of the stuff to be implemented.
